### What I learned

What an incredible journey! This project was great to put into practice splitting my application into small, re-usable components which is one of the key principles of working with React, and allow the application to scale.

It was also my first time implementing a theme toggler on a page - I managed to accomplish this with the usage of Context API. Although it works, I have the feeling it is not the optimal solution and will attempt to implement a similar feature with Styled Components for my next project!
